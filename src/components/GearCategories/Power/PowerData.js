    info: "MDG ATMe Haze GeneratorÂ was designed with safety and reliability in mind and is capable of generating pure white, non-toxic haze for as long as you have fluid (100% duty cycle). This generator is also equipped, as a standard feature, with the Automatic Purging System (APS). This system purges the heating module after the first heating cycle and after every emission of haze preventing residual build up and clogging. Requires a CO2 tank to run.",
